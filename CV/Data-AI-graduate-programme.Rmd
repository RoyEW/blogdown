### Dear Sir or Madam

Courses for the R programming language from Jumping Rivers funded by the Bangor Doctoral School sparked my interest in data science. These courses provided an excellent introduction to the R statistical programming language aimed to train researchers to become competent users of R. These courses provided me with the confidence to interrogate and extract meaning from data, as well as the confidence to explore packages on CRAN to discover what else I could do with the language. I went on to build a website in R using the blogdown package which can be found at [RoyWilson.UK](https://RoyWilson.UK). This has proved useful in storing useful snippets of code that can be easily shared with others. I also built an interactive dashboard in R shiny which calculates the thermophysical properties and the thermal expansion coefficients of a selected alloy composition. This dashboard can be found at [RoyWilson.UK/HEA/](https://RoyWilson.UK/HEA/). I have also explored machine learning techniques found within the caret package and applied them to datasets from the TidyTuesday project with success in building predictive models. 

I studied Accounting and Finance with an MSc (Distinction) and a BSc (First-class). The recent master's programme provided me with training and an appreciation for the philosophy of science, and a strong interest in working with data and applied statistical techniques. The programme has developed my analytical capabilities and instilled confidence and curiosity for tackling complex problems.

I have picked up practical skills in Python and SQL throughout various courses. Soon after being introduced to python, I noticed that my brother and his supervisors were downloading molecular data from a supercomputer to then randomise in Excel, with each file being saved separately and re-uploaded to the supercomputer. I wrote a script in Python that takes in arguments from the user to automatically produce any number of randomised molecular data files that retain their unique structure. The script also organised the directories appropriately to aid in running calculations and produces these input files directly on the supercomputer without any need for downloading or uploading data. The ability to run this process directly from the command line interface has saved my brother and his research group countless hours by allowing them to focus on the science, rather than repetitive processes. 

I am excited about the opportunity that this programme provides. I want to be able to develop my data skills and understanding of cutting-edge techniques within data science and be able to combine that with my business acumen to enhance what value I could bring to any future roles. I would also highly benefit from a structured programme to complement my informal data skills journey. I see myself finding a lot of success on the Data/AI Fast Track Graduate programme as it looks to offer a stimulating challenge in an area that I thoroughly enjoy. 



Sincerely,

Roy Wilson
