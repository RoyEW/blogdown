Dear Sir or Madam,

\hfill

I am pleased to apply for the data/AI fast track graduate programme with Graduate Programme Wales.


I enjoyed early experience with programming in VB.NET from a young age. This led me to jump at the opportunity to undertake courses for the R programming language with Jumping Rivers funded by the Bangor Doctoral School. These courses sparked my interest in data analytics and I was keen to explore what else R could offer. I went on to build a website in R which can be found at [RoyWilson.UK](https://RoyWilson.UK). This has proved useful as a resource for various snippets of code. I also built an interactive dashboard in R shiny which calculates the thermal expansion coefficients of a selected alloy composition. This dashboard can be found at [RoyWilson.UK/HEA/](https://RoyWilson.UK/HEA/). I have also explored machine learning techniques found within the caret package and applied them to datasets from the TidyTuesday project with success in building predictive models. I have also picked up practical skills in Python and SQL throughout various courses. 

I studied Accounting and Finance at Bangor University with an MSc (Distinction) and a BSc (First-class). The recent master's programme provided me with a strong interest in working with data and applied statistical techniques as well as developed my analytical capabilities and instilled confidence and curiosity for tackling complex problems.



I am excited about the opportunity that this programme provides. I want to be able to further my data skills and understanding of cutting-edge techniques within data science and be able to combine that with my business acumen to enhance what value I could bring to any future roles, hopefully with a career in Wales. I see myself finding a lot of success on the data/AI fast track programme as it looks to offer a stimulating challenge in an area that I thoroughly enjoy.

Yours faithfully,

\hfill

Roy Wilson
