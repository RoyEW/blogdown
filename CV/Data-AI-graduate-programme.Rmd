My background is in Accounting and Finance with an MSc (Distinction) and a BSc (First-class). The masters programme provided me with an appreciation for the philosophy of science, and a strong interest in working with data and applying statistical techniques. Data and statistical heavy modules include statistical methods, research methods, financial econometrics, among general mathematical applications within finance. I undertook maths at A level and have been enjoying recapping and developing my mathematical ability since.

I am excited for the opportunity that this programme provides. It looks to be an excellent way to combine what I have learnt and my interests into an excellent foundation for a career in data science. What draws me to data science is its potential for life-long learning, where the data scientist is on the frontier of development of cutting-edge techniques and software packages. 

Since graduation, I have undertook courses provided by the Bangor University Doctoral School which I gained new skills in statistical programming as well as confidence in my ability to interrogate and extract meaning from data. A handful of intensive courses from Jumping Rivers provided an excellent introduction to the R statistical programming language aimed to train researchers to become 'advanced beginners' using the R statistical programming language. The courses include an introduction to R, data manipulation, statistical modelling in R, R functional programming, and advanced graphics in R. These courses provided me with the basics as well as the confidence to explore packages on CRAN to discover what else I could do with the language. I went on to build a website in R using the blogdown package, of which is found at RoyWilson.UK. This has proved useful in storing useful code snippets that I can easily share with others. I have also assisted my brother with his research into high entropy alloys by building an interactive dashboard in R shiny which calculates thermophysical properties and the thermal expansion coefficients of a selected alloy composition quickly and with ease for the user. This dashboard can be found at RoyWilson.UK/HEA/. I have also explored machine learning techniques found within the caret package and applied them to datasets found on Kaggle with success in building predictive models. 

I have also picked up practical skills in Python, and SQL throughout various courses. I really enjoy learning new tools as well as seeing what I can build with them, and I see this as a fun hobby. 

I see myself finding a lot of success on the Data/AI Fast Track Graduate programme as it looks to offer a stimulating challenge in an area that I really enjoy. 

Sincerely,

Roy Wilson
