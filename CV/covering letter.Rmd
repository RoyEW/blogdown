I have an interest in data analytics and an interest in learning new technologies to build on my abilities. Joining Deutsche Bank in this capacity would be a fantastic opportunity for me to explore more about Deutsche Bank and how I could support it in its business strategy. 

I believe that I would benefit from this technology programme from Deutsche Bank as it will provide structure to my learning and provide the opportunity to expand on my interests and add value in a real-world setting. 


Sincerely,

Roy Wilson
