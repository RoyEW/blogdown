I have an interest in data analytics and an interest in learning new technologies to build on my abilities.  Joining the programme in this capacity would be a fantastic opportunity for me to explore more about Deutsche Bank and how I could support it in its business strategy. 

I believe that I would benefit from this technology programme from Deutsche Bank as it will provide structure to my learning and provide the opportunity to expand on my interests and add value in a real-world setting. 

I have an interest in data analytics and applied statistics and I have developed my skills since graduating with the tools often used for data analysis. I have undertook courses provided by the Bangor University Doctoral School which I gained new skills and confidence in my ability to interrogate data and extract as much information as possible. A few courses from Jumping Rivers provided an excellent introduction to the R statistical programming language aimed to train 'advanced beginners' using R for data science. The courses include an introduction to R, data manipulation, statistical modelling in R, R functional programming, and advanced graphics in R. picked up practical skills in R, Python, and SQL
